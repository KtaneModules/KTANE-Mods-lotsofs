Vanilla:
* No changes besides some behind the scenes stuff

Vanilla_AlternativeNumbering:
* Pages are numbered in a more future proof way:
-- The introductionory pages are still numbered as before, but without the 'of 23' (eg. "Page 2")
-- Solvable module pages have their numbering prefixed with "1.", starting countdown at "Page 1.1" for the title page.
-- Needy module pages have their numbering prefixed with "2.", starting countdown at "Page 2.1" for the title page.
-- Appendices will have roman numeral page numbering, eg. "Page III".

Modded Manuals:
* By default, besides distinction between solvable, needy & appendix, page ordering will be determined by module release date, similar to how the vanilla manual is not sorted alphabetically either.  

Road To Centurion 1:
* Page numbering may not be accurate, due to the non-chronological order I am processing these
* Colour Flash: BTS changes & Ink splatter patterns
* Turn The Key: Ink splatter
* Turn The Keys: Ink splatter, BTS changes.
-- Decreased font sizes because the manual didn't actually fit on one page.
* 3D Maze: BTS Stuff, Ink Splatters
-- Added a reference to Appendix A
* Skewed Slots: Ink
-- Appendix placed in appendices

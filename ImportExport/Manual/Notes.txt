Flavor Text:
There is one thing missing from this great bomb: A celebrity endorsed used module shop. That's why I founded Sunshine Used Modules. Every one of these beauties is freshly painted; they look brand-new. We have new models coming in every morning (usually around 2AM). We can get you anything! And if you see the module of your dreams? Tell us, we can acquire it for you!

  description: 'I learn much better using small mini campaigns to guide me through
    to a dedicated goal. In this pack I will just dump some missions made for selfish
    reasons aimed at learning some modules found on whatever challenge bomb I plan
    on trying next, as a sort of crash course for the modules to come. The assumption
    is made that prior knowledge for all Praetorian modules already exists. Whenever
    I plan on doing a new challenge bomb, I will add a quick section to this for me
    to practice with. I''m making this public though, because why not?


    Current bomb training sections:

    * Quizmaster (11 missions, 19 modules introduced)

    * Swan Hell (5 missions, 7 modules introduced (1 from previous section))'

    Update log:

    2020-01-27:

    * Rewritten a few lines in the manual for clarification. This does not affect
    any gameplay rules.

    * TPP support changes:

    - * Moved some note positions slightly as the TPP indicator covered up part of
    the note sometimes.

    - * Fixed an error that would occur if the player tried to couple null.

    - * Added chat feedback for players trying to flip non-existant notes.

    - * Added administrator autosolve support.

    While the manual has changed, the old manual is still applicable. Should you desire
    to keep your manuals up to date, only page 5 needs to be reprinted.


    2020-01-26:

    * The entire train now no longer gets reset when striking.

    While the manual has changed a little due to this, an entire reprint is not strictly
    required. Just cross out the sentence that says a new train must be built from
    the start on page 1, or reprint just that page.


    2020-01-23:

    * Initial Release

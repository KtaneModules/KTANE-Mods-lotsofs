  description: "If you thought bombs on trains were bad, now we have trains on bombs.\n\nCouple
    the correct railroad cars to the train to disarm the module.\n\n------\r\nIncludes
    support for mods:\r\nTwitch Plays, w/ Autosolve\r\n\r\n------\nUpdate log:\n2020-02-04:\n*
    TPP support changes:\n- * Sequential autosolving\n\n2020-01-27:\n* Rewritten a
    few lines in the manual for clarification. This does not affect any gameplay rules.\n*
    TPP support changes:\n- * Moved some note positions slightly as the TPP indicator
    covered up part of the note sometimes.\n- * Fixed an error that would occur if
    the player tried to couple null.\n- * Added chat feedback for players trying to
    flip non-existant notes.\n- * Added administrator autosolve support.\nWhile the
    manual has changed, the old manual is still applicable. Should you desire to keep
    your manuals up to date, only page 5 needs to be reprinted.\n\n2020-01-26:\n*
    The entire train now no longer gets reset when striking.\nWhile the manual has
    changed a little due to this, an entire reprint is not strictly required. Just
    cross out the sentence that says a new train must be built from the start on page
    1, or reprint just that page.\n\n2020-01-23:\n* Initial Release\n\n------\nFound
    an issue? You can find me at discord.gg/lotsofs , but I am also pingable in the
    official KTANE discord server, or the KTANE modding discord server. Or just post
    a comment below. "

  description: "If you thought bombs on trains were bad, now we have trains on bombs.\r\n\r\nCouple
    the correct railroad cars to the train to disarm the module.\r\n\r\n------\r\nIncludes
    support for mods:\r\nTwitch Plays, w/ Autosolve\r\n\r\n------\r\nUpdate log:\r\n2020-08-01:\r\n*
    Toggled a setting that should hopefully now make the module VR compatible.\r\n*
    Resources are removed from the list if the player strikes due to misremembering
    whether their freight table rule has been applied on cars 12 and beyond.\r\n*
    Upon a strike, the train will now drive into position. This allows you to take
    a look at it in case you forgot what an earlier car was but it needs to be remembered.\r\n*
    Fixed a cosmetic bug where the note would not indent lines preceded by an empty
    line.\r\n* Incorrectly attached baggage cars now no longer store future passengers'
    baggage.\r\n* Removed legacy code that involved edgework on whether the train
    was long-haul and whether the list generates a nuclear reactor pressure vessel
    instead of an electrical generator. This should have no noticeable effect. \r\n*
    Increased the chance of electrical generators/nuclear reactor pressure vessels
    appearing by a bit (from 1/100 to 1/80)\r\n* The solve of the module now happens
    during the ending cinematic, after the bottom screen turns off, but before the
    top screen does. This fits better within the module's asynchronous style of shutting
    off, and also allows twitch plays camera wall players to enjoy the cinematic.\r\n*
    Twitch Plays:\r\n- * Removed the unsubmittable penalty.\r\n- * Added alternative
    controls: !up !down !select !cycle\r\n- * Fixed some incorrect terminology in
    the help message\r\n* Manual:\r\n- * Using my newly learned CSS abilities, I moved
    some of the main car instructions closer together so it fits more on one page.\r\n-
    * This leaves room on page 5 to mention some of the above changes where needed,
    as well as the last instruction which was previously awkwardly placed on page
    6.\r\n- * Fixed a minor spelling mistake.\r\n- * Added some additional underlining
    and bolding to emphasize some things, most notably to help distinguish the eighth
    car's instructions from the seventh's.\r\nNo manual reprint is required, as the
    gameplay rules haven't changed. However, it is strongly recommended, as all but
    the last page have been changed significantly.\r\n\r\n2020-06-07:\r\n* Manual:
    Added a bullet point to each of the car tables' instructions referring to the
    cargo notes section. A reprint is recommended for pages 6 and 7, but not strictly
    needed, as no rules have been changed.\r\n* Twitch Plays: Block any commands coming
    in during a stage transition. This should avoid issues with accidental double-sending
    of commands, as well as overenthusiastic caboose connectors.\r\n\r\n2020-02-06:\r\n*
    Fixed a bug that would cause the module to immediately skip to car 13's rules
    on car 14, without evaluating its own rules first.\r\n\r\n2020-02-04:\r\n* TPP
    support changes:\r\n- * Sequential autosolving\r\n\r\n2020-01-27:\r\n* Rewritten
    a few lines in the manual for clarification. This does not affect any gameplay
    rules.\r\n* TPP support changes:\r\n- * Moved some note positions slightly as
    the TPP indicator covered up part of the note sometimes.\r\n- * Fixed an error
    that would occur if the player tried to couple null.\r\n- * Added chat feedback
    for players trying to flip non-existant notes.\r\n- * Added administrator autosolve
    support.\r\nWhile the manual has changed, the old manual is still applicable.
    Should you desire to keep your manuals up to date, only page 5 needs to be reprinted.\r\n\r\n2020-01-26:\r\n*
    The entire train now no longer gets reset when striking.\r\nWhile the manual has
    changed a little due to this, an entire reprint is not strictly required. Just
    cross out the sentence that says a new train must be built from the start on page
    1, or reprint just that page.\r\n\r\n2020-01-23:\r\n* Initial Release\r\n\r\n------\r\nFound
    an issue? You can find me at discord.gg/lotsofs , but I am also pingable in the
    official KTANE discord server, or the KTANE modding discord server. Or just post
    a comment below."

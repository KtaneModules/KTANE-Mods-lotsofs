  description: "If you thought bombs on trains were bad, now we have trains on bombs.\r\n\r\nCouple
    the correct railroad cars to the train to disarm the module.\r\n\r\n------\r\nIncludes
    support for mods:\r\nTwitch Plays, w/ Autosolve\r\n\r\n------\r\nUpdate log:\r\n2020-06-07:\n*
    Manual: Added a bullet point to each of the car tables' instructions referring
    to the cargo notes section. A reprint is recommended for pages 6 and 7, but not
    strictly needed, as no rules have been changed.\n* Twitch Plays: Block any commands
    coming in during a stage transition. This should avoid issues with accidental
    double-sending of commands, as well as overenthusiastic caboose connectors.\n\n2020-02-06:\r\n*
    Fixed a bug that would cause the module to immediately skip to car 13's rules
    on car 14, without evaluating its own rules first.\r\n\r\n2020-02-04:\r\n* TPP
    support changes:\r\n- * Sequential autosolving\r\n\r\n2020-01-27:\r\n* Rewritten
    a few lines in the manual for clarification. This does not affect any gameplay
    rules.\r\n* TPP support changes:\r\n- * Moved some note positions slightly as
    the TPP indicator covered up part of the note sometimes.\r\n- * Fixed an error
    that would occur if the player tried to couple null.\r\n- * Added chat feedback
    for players trying to flip non-existant notes.\r\n- * Added administrator autosolve
    support.\r\nWhile the manual has changed, the old manual is still applicable.
    Should you desire to keep your manuals up to date, only page 5 needs to be reprinted.\r\n\r\n2020-01-26:\r\n*
    The entire train now no longer gets reset when striking.\r\nWhile the manual has
    changed a little due to this, an entire reprint is not strictly required. Just
    cross out the sentence that says a new train must be built from the start on page
    1, or reprint just that page.\r\n\r\n2020-01-23:\r\n* Initial Release\r\n\r\n------\r\nFound
    an issue? You can find me at discord.gg/lotsofs , but I am also pingable in the
    official KTANE discord server, or the KTANE modding discord server. Or just post
    a comment below."

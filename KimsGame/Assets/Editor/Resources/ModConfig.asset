  description: "Look on them as long as thou wilt, stranger. Count and, if need be,
    handle. One look is enough for me. When thou hast counted and handled and art
    sure that thou canst remember them all, I cover them with this paper, and thou
    must tell over the tally to the bomb. I will do the same.\r\n\r\nRemember the
    icons placed on the belt.\r\n\r\n------\r\nIncludes support for mods:\r\n* Twitch
    Plays, w/ Autosolve\r\n\r\n------\r\nFound an issue? You can find me at discord.gg/lotsofs
    , but I am also pingable in the official KTANE discord server, or the KTANE modding
    discord server. Or just post a comment below."

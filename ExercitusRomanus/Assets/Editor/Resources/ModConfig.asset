  description: "Enjoy a journey back in time with the Roman Army of Bombs. \r\n\r\nThis
    is a mission pack that will take you on a journey through the history of KTANE
    and its mods by giving you small bite-sized bombs, each with 11 modules determined
    by release order. \r\n\r\n[h1]A wide range of choices[/h1]\r\nThis mission pack
    is a 3-in-1, each with their own table of contents:\r\n[h3]The Legionarii[/h3]
    These are the classic 10 solvable + 1 needy bombs. Needies may lag behind or get
    ahead of the solvables due to their separate release schedule. These bombs are
    most suited for those who want to learn about the mod history of KTANE while also
    enjoying the classic KTANE challenge and everything the community had to offer.\r\n[h3]The
    Auxilia[/h3] No needies, just 11 solvable modules. Perfect for those time travel
    tourists who don't care about needies. \r\n[h3]The Comitatenses[/h3] 11 modules,
    but the ratio solvable to needy is entirely determined by when a module was released.
    These bombs represent the most accurate chronology of all the modded modules that
    the KTANE community has to offer, but beware; you may get bombs with 5 needies
    at once, or not see a needy for 5 bombs in a row.\r\n\r\nThe time limit for all
    these bombs has been set to 60 minutes, as holidays are not supposed to be stressful.
    This leaves you plenty of time to be a tourist in time. There will still be only
    3 strikes though, so behave. We don't want Rome to fall into civil war again.\r\n\r\n[h1]Something
    for everyone[/h1]\r\nHowever, the Roman Army of Bombs' tourist board realizes
    that a relaxation holiday is not for everyone, so they have come up with alternative
    holiday ideas for those who prefer a different style of holiday:\r\n* For the
    adrenaline junkies who want additional difficulty: How fast can you [b][u]speedrun[/u][/b]
    the history of KTANE?\r\n* For those who prefer to have their holidays be educative
    instead, or who are only just starting to embark on their journey throughout all
    of KTANE: Use the relaxed timer to [b][u]learn[/u][/b] new modules on your journey
    through time.\r\n* Or simply lay back, grab a drink, enjoy the modules, and [b][u]have
    fun[/u][/b] with your friends.\r\nExercitus Romanus pro omnis est! Everyone is
    welcome here!\r\n\r\n[i](Historians have currently only uncovered the KTANE history
    up to and including the year 2771 ab urbe condita (or MMXVIII to you time-foreigners).
    The following years will be added as the present continues to become history.)[/i]\r\n\r\nPlease
    contact the Senate (me) for any inquiries you may have."

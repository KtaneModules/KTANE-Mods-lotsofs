  description: "Enjoy a journey back in time with the Roman Army of Bombs. \n\nThis
    is a mission pack that will take you on a journey through the history of modded
    KTANE by giving you small bombs, each with 11 modules in release order. \n\nThis
    mission pack is a 4-in-1, each with their own table of contents:\n* The Legionarii:
    These are the classic 10 solvable + 1 needy bombs. Needies may lag behind or get
    ahead of the solvables due to their separate release schedule however. These bombs
    are most suited for those who want to learn about the mod history of KTANE while
    also enjoying the classic KTANE challenge.\n* The Auxilia: No needies, just 11
    solvable modules. Perfect for those time travel tourists who don't care about
    needies. \n* The Comitatenses: 11 modules, but the ratio solvable to needy is
    entirely determined by when a module was released. These bombs represent the most
    accurate chronology of all the modded modules the KTANE community has to offer.\n*
    The Operarii Fabrica: Offers factory mode variants of all of the above, for those
    who want a continuous challenge without being interupted, or saved for that matter,
    by the office room.\n\nSince these are not meant to be difficult (with the exception
    of the Operarii Fabrica), each Decanus has a 20 minute timer and allows 3 strikes.
    Please contact the Senate (me) if you think one should have these increased. For
    optional additional difficulty: How fast can you speedrun the history of KTANE?\n\nHistorians
    have currently only uncovered the KTANE history up to and including the year 2771
    ab urbe condita (2018). The following years will be added as the present continues
    to become history. \n"

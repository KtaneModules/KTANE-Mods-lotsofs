                    <p>Instructions on how to do long multiplication:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Multiply the number in the ones place of the multiplier by the number in the ones place of the multiplicand. If this results in a two digit number, carry over the leftmost digit into the next step.</li>
                        <li>Multiply the number in the ones place of the multiplier by the number in the tens place of the multiplicand, and add the potential digit carried from the previous step. Carry the leftmost digit again like before (This would be the digit in the hundreds place).</li>
                        <li>Also do the above steps for the hundreds, thousands, etc. place of the multiplicand, until there are no numbers left in the multiplicand. Don't forget to add a potential final carry.</li>
                        <li>Repeat the above steps, but using the number in the tens place of the multiplier, then the hundreds place, etc., until there are no more numbers left in the multiplier.</li>
                        <li>Use long addition to find the sum of all the numbers calculated in the steps above. First take all the digits in each of the terms' ones places and add them all together. Again, take care to carry digits as before.</li>
                        <li>Do the above, but for the numbers in the tens place, then the hundreds place, etc. Again, don't forget the final carry. This will yield the final answer.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The Asterisk Number is a number that is the same across all modules on the bomb that use it.</li>
                        <li>The initial value of the Asterisk Number can be found by multiplying the third character of the serial number by 5 and adding the last character of the serial number. If both the third and last character of the serial are 0, the initial value is 30.
                        <li>Modules that use the Asterisk Number can be recognized by a large square panel with a red asterisk scribbled onto it.</li>
                        <li>When a module that uses the Asterisk Number is solved, it will mutate the number. That is, the number will change. The new Asterisk Number will then need to be used for any remaining modules on the bomb that use the number.</li>
                        <li>The Asterisk Number can be reset to its initial value by holding down the square panel on any module. Doing so will incur a strike on the bomb.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Mutation</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When a module using the Asterisk Number is solved, it will mutate it.</li>
                        <li>The amount with which the number is mutated, depends on the module and can be found on each module's page. The mutation will always occur with a number between 1 and 99.</li>
                        <li>Mutations happen as follows:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Initially, the mutation value is <b>added</b> to the Asterisk Number. Eg.: 20 ± 10 = 30.</li>
                            <li>The Asterisk Number cannot be higher than 99. In the event that addition would cause the Asterisk Number to go above 99, the remainder is <b>subtracted</b> instead. Eg.: 95 ± 10 = 93.</li>
                            <li>From then on, any subsequent mutations will be done by <b>subtracting</b>, until the Asterisk Number hits its lower bound of 1, after which it turns back to <b>addition</b>. Eg.: 8 ± 10 = 4.</li>
                            <li>In short, the Asterisk Number will go back and forth between 1 and 99.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>

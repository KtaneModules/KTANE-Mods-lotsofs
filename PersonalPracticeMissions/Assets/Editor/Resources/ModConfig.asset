  title: Road To Centurion
  author: S.
  description: "Short info: A campaign that helps you learn and then practice modules
    found on the Centurion, including the needies released before Yahtzee.\r\n\r\nLong
    info: These are some missions I made for myself & my friends to work towards a
    long term goal of defusing the Centurion, starting from never having played a
    single modded module before. The objective at first was to practice modules we
    learned in a more reliable way than to generate random bombs and hope we get what
    we want. Later, I decided to turn these missions into something that might actually
    help us learn and introduces us to the modules. For me and my friends, it's worked
    pretty well. I'm not sure how well it will work for a stranger with different
    preparation rituals than us, but I figured I'd release it anyway.\r\n\r\nThe campaign
    is divided into several sections. Each section contains 22 bombs. The first part
    of each section will introduce new modules, the middle part will recap what you've
    learned and give some gimmicky bombs, and the last part contains some staple boss
    bombs that really test your new abilities, and these don't mess about: If you
    can do these bombs, you are definitely ready to take on the Centurion as far as
    that section is concerned. Because of this, even if you're an experienced player,
    you might find some interesting bombs in this campaign, particularly towards the
    end of each section. \r\n\r\nFor experienced players' convenience, the toughest
    bombs have been conglomerated into a separate table of contents called 'Best Of',
    to make access for those players who would like a challenge easier.\r\n\r\nNote:
    Since KTANE consists of so much more than only the Centurion. Your journey will
    not end with the Centurion. Therefore, this campaign will also train you for situations
    that you would never encounter on the Centurion itself, but that will undoubtably
    occur in your future endeavours. Especially some of the gimmicky bombs might be
    ridiculous, and serve more as an intermediate challenge rather than proper preparation
    for the Centurion. There is no shame in skipping bombs. Getting stuck on bombs
    doesn't prepare you.\r\n\r\nBombs have been playtested for 1 defuser and 2 experts.
    An attempt was made to balance most bombs for 1 defuser & 1 expert, but this is
    not tested. The bombs are possible for EFM, but some of the bombs might be very
    difficult with only one expert, especially for a new player. Also note that these
    missions go beyond just priming you for the Centurion. Scenarios are presented
    that the Centurion never will, to ensure your journey to the Centurion will not
    be clouded in tunnel vision.\r\n\r\nThanks to PowerSlaveAlfons and EthanH59 for
    being my partners in defusal.\r\n\r\nResources:\r\nManuals can be found at the
    repo at http://ktane.timwi.de , but I've also prepared custom manuals per section
    to go with the campaigns, which can be found here:\r\nhttps://lotsofs.github.io/KTANE/#RoadToCenturion\r\n\r\nGet

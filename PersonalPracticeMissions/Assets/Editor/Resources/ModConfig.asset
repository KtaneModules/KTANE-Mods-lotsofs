  description: "These are some missions I made for myself & my friends (this is you
    if I linked this to you) to practice/learn some modded modules. Most if not all
    of them are nothing special, but maybe there's a few in there that are suitable
    or pose an interesting challenge to experienced players.\n\nEach section consists
    of three sub-sections: New modules are introduced first, then there's some missions
    mixing it up, followed by a handful of more challenging bombs.\n\nGet the modules
    here:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1930830340 \n\nOther
    mods required to play these missions:\nAny case that supports 31 modules, which

                    <h2>On the Subject of Microphones</h2>

					<ul>
						<li>The module presents a microphone on the left. To disarm the module, it must be destroyed by blowing out its diaphragm.</li>
						<li>The microphone has built-in security systems that will automatically disable it if it gets overloaded.</li>
						<li>However, there is a deaf spot between the microphone's blow out point, and the volume at which the security kicks in.</li>
						<li>To blow out the diaphragm, set the volume knob to the microphone's deaf spot, then play a loud sound into the microphone for the correct duration.</li>
						<li>A volume knob is found in the bottom right. It ranges from 0 to 5. Pressing it will increase volume by one, looping around back to 0 when going above the maximum.</li>
						<li>There is also a record button in the top right, which enables/disables the microphone. There also may be a pop filter.</li>
						</ul>


                    <h3>Examples of loud enough sounds</h3>
					<p>The bomb itself can only produce two sounds loud enough to blow the microphone's diaphragm, these being:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>The striking sound</li>
					<li>The bomb exploding</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Unfortunately, both of these two sounds come with negative side-effects. There are no other known audio sources present on the bomb that are loud enough. It is adviced that the defuser instead uses an external device for the production of the required loud sound.</p>


                    <h3>Step one:</h3>
					<p>Calculate the microphone's deaf spot:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Take the initial position of the volume knob. This can range from 0, at the bottom of the module, to 5, at the top.</li>
						<li>Subtract 1 for each Stereo RCA port on the bomb. (Each red-white pair counts as one port.)</li>
						<li>If there is a pop filter on the module, add 1. Pop filters can be identified as large round dark-colored filters placed over the microphone.</li>
						<li>If the value is negative, multiply it by -2.</li>
						<li>If the value is higher than 5, change it to 0.</li>
					</ol>

					<h3>Step two:</h3>
					<p>If the red LED on the record button is already flashing without any input from the defuser, the module is currently listening in on the defuser. If the red LED is already completely off, this step can be skipped.</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Pressing the button to stop the recording manually will incur a strike, as will lowering the volume knob.</li>
					<li>The recording must be force-stopped by intentionally causing the microphone's security system to kick in. </li>
					<li>This can be done by setting the volume knob to above the deaf spot and then playing the loud sound. (Set the volume to 5 if the deaf spot is 5, as this is the maximum; do not attempt to move the volume knob beyond 5.)</li>
					<li>If the played sound is loud enough, the security will kick in. This will stop the recording, indicated by the LED turning off completely. Leave the sound playing if this does not happen immediately.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Step three:</h3>
					<p>With the recording stopped, the volume knob can now safely be lowered and adjusted at will.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Set the volume knob to the microphone's deaf spot.</li>
						<li>Press the record button to enable the microphone.</li>
						<li>Play the loud sound. At this point, if the volume knob is set incorrectly, the recording will stop and a strike will be incurred (in that order).</li>
						<li>If successful, do <b>not</b> stop the sound or touch the volume knob at this point, unless the instructions from step four specify otherwise.</li>
					</ol>
					
					<h3>Step four:</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>If the deaf spot is 0, the volume knob must be increased by 1 until it reaches maximum volume 5. Do this with a speed of at most one increase per tick of the bomb's timer.</li>
						<li>If the deaf spot is 1, change the volume to 5 at any point, and leave it there for at least one tick of the bomb's timer and at most three. Then set it to 0.</li>
						<li>If the deaf spot is 2, change the volume to 3 after at least 5 ticks of the bomb's timer.</li>
						<li>If the deaf spot is 5, change it to 4 before seven ticks of the bomb's timer have passed. Leave it there for at least 1 tick, then change it back to 5.</li>
					</ol>

                    <h2>On the Subject of Microphones</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">Shhhh, it can hear us.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>A microphone is on the left. To disarm the module, it must be destroyed by blowing out its diaphragm.</li>
						<li>The microphone has built-in security systems that will automatically disable it if it gets overloaded.</li>
						<li>However, there is a deaf spot between the microphone's blow out point, and the volume at which the security kicks in.</li>
						<li>To blow out the diaphragm, set the volume knob to the microphone's deaf spot, then play a loud sound into the microphone for the correct duration.</li>
						<li>A volume knob is found in the bottom right. It ranges from 0 to 5. Pressing it will increase the recording volume by one, looping around back to 0 when going above the maximum.</li>
						<li>There is also a record button in the top right, which enables/disables the microphone, and there may also be a pop filter.</li>
						</ul>


                    <h4>Examples of loud enough sounds</h4>
					<p>The bomb itself can only produce two sounds loud enough to blow the microphone's diaphragm. These are:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>The striking sound</li>
					<li>The bomb exploding</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Unfortunately, while more effective at destroying the diaphragm due to internal vibrations caused in the bomb, both of these two sounds come with negative side-effects. It is adviced that the defuser instead uses an external device for the production of the required loud sound.</p>


                    <h3>Step one:</h3>
					<p>Calculate the microphone's deaf spot:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Take the initial position of the volume knob.</li>
						<li>Subtract 1 for each Stereo RCA port on the bomb (Two jacks make one port).</li>
						<li>If there is a pop filter on the module, add 1. Pop filters can be identified as large round dark-colored filters placed over the microphone.</li>
						<li>If the value is negative, multiply it by -2.</li>
						<li>If the value is higher than 5, change it to 0.</li>
					</ol>

					<h3>Step two:</h3>
					<p>If the red LED on the record button is blinking, the module is currently listening in on the defuser. It must be turned off first. 
					Pressing the button to do so manually will incur a strike, as will lowering the volume knob. 
					The recording must be force-stopped by intentionally causing the microphone's security system to kick in.
					If the LED is already off, this step can be skipped.</p>
					<ol>
					<li>Set the volume knob to above the deaf spot. Set the volume to 5 if the deaf spot is 5; do not attempt to move the volume knob beyond the maximum of 5.</li>
					<li>Play the loud sound.</li>
					<li>If the played sound is loud enough, the LED will stop blinking and light up completely. Leave the sound playing until the security kicks in. This will stop the recording, indicated by the LED turning off completely.</li>
					</ol>

					<h3>Step three:</h3>
					<p>With the recording stopped, the volume knob can now safely be lowered.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Set the volume knob to the microphone's deaf spot.</li>
						<li>Press the record button to enable the microphone.</li>
						<li>Play the loud sound. At this point, if the volume knob is set incorrectly, the recording will stop and a strike will be incurred (in that order).</li>
						<li>If successful, do <b>not</b> stop the sound or touch the volume knob at this point, unless the instructions from step four specify otherwise.</li>
					</ol>
					
					<h3>Step four:</h3>
					<p>With the sound playing, perform the following special instructions in order to destroy the diaphragm for good.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>If the deaf spot is 5, change it to 4 before seven ticks of the bomb's timer have passed. Leave it there for at least 1 tick, then change it back to 5.</li>
						<li>If the deaf spot is 2, change the volume to 3 after at least 5 ticks of the bomb's timer.</li>
						<li>If the deaf spot is 1, change the volume to 5 at any point, and leave it there for at least one tick of the bomb's timer and at most three. Then set it to 0.</li>
						<li>If the deaf spot is 0, the volume knob must be increased by 1 until it reaches the maximum volume of 5. Do this with a speed of at most one increase per tick of the bomb's timer.</li>
						<li>If there is an SND indicator on the bomb, stop the sound and start it again.</li>
						<li>The round microphone types will break at this point. Otherwise, the sound must be played for 10 more seconds, give or take.</li>

  description: "Shhhh, it can hear us.\n\r\nBlow out the microphone's diaphragm by
    playing a loud sound into it while manipulating the microphone's recording volume
    in the correct way.\n\n------\nIncludes support for mods:\nTwitch Plays, w/ Autosolve\n\n------\r\nUpdate
    log:\r\n\r\n2020-02-04:\n* Changed an ambiguous sentence in the manual.\n* Added
    an appendix with some fun excerpts.\n* Fixed he LED not behaving correctly if
    the player somehow managed to get to step 4 before the lights come on at the start.\n*
    TPP Support changes:\n- * Sequential autosolving\n- * Added the ability to play
    an alternative sound if the TP host has the alarm set to autosnooze, but the player
    must work for it.\nReprinting the manual is not strictly required, as the rules
    haven't changed. However, if you'd like to keep your prints up to date for aesthetic
    reasons, then you must reprint the manual.\n\n2020-02-03:\n* Fixed a critical
    error that would occur when the player uses customized sound mods. The module
    is now compatible with those mods.\n\n2020-02-02:\r\n* Initial Release\r\n\r\n------\r\nFound
    an issue? You can find me at discord.gg/lotsofs , but I am also pingable in the
    official KTANE discord server, or the KTANE modding discord server. Or just post
    a comment below."

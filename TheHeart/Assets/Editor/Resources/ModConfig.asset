  title: The Heart
  author: S.
  description: "It's true; bombs can feel emotions too. How exciting is that?\r\n\r\nDefibrillate
    the heart until it solves. When does it solve? Well, there's the trick...\r\n\r\n------\r\nDisclaimer:\r\nThis
    module is a pseudo-needy. It will behave like a needy module until its solve conditions
    are met.\r\n\r\n------\r\nIncludes support for mods:\r\nTwitch Plays, w/ Autosolve\r\n\r\n------\r\nUpdate
    log:\r\n2020-06-07:\r\nMANUAL REPRINT REQUIRED: \r\n* Removed the rule about adding
    2 times the amount of solved hearts, and replaced it with a simple 'two hearts
    can not solve at once' rule. This will prevent multiple hearts stalling the bomb
    for more time than the sum of each heart individually.\r\n* Will no longer solve
    in response to other modules being solved in timemode, as players calculating/knowing
    how much time is added for each solved module is outside of the scope of this
    module. Added an extra rule that deals specifically with this scenario, to avoid
    the module stalling the bomb for multiple minutes.\r\n\r\n2020-05-20:\r\n* Updated
    the manual to clarify and emphasize some things, and fixed the SVG (the status
    light was black). This update does not change any rules, so a manual reprint is
    not strictly required, but it is recommended if you plan on sharing the manual
    with friends.\r\n\r\n2020-05-17:\r\n* Twitch plays stuff:\r\n-- Added the word
    'optional' to the help message to clarify that adding seconds is not needed.\r\n--
    Fixed the module yelling 'invalid command' despite a command being valid.\r\n--
    Added elevator music when delaying the defib for over 15 seconds.\r\n\r\n2020-05-15:\r\n*
    Initial Release\r\n\r\n------\r\nFound an issue? You can find me at discord.gg/lotsofs
    , but I am also pingable in the official KTANE discord server, or the KTANE modding
    discord server. Or just post a comment below."
